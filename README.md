# Baby Names
iOS Swift Application for Baby Names

These names are categorized based on gender (masculine and feminine) for easy navigating through records. The app also indexed and sorted names based on alphabetic order. This will help users to quickly jump to a section they want and look for a name. Beside this, a robust search engine is in a place to search for a name using the search bar. Names are listed both in English and native letters, and full details appear once the name is tapped. The detail page shows the meaning of a name, origin, and gender. Another cool feature is adding names to the favorite list for a quick navigation of the list later. Users can also share a name through a social network or text messaging.
